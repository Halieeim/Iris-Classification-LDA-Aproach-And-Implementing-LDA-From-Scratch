# Iris-Classification-LDA-Aproach-And-Implementing-LDA-From-Scratch
Classifying iris dataset with LDA algorithm which is built in library in python and implementing LDA from scratch

> ####Our project is divided into two phases
>> 1) Reading dataset and splitting it into train and test and then classifying it with built-in LDA Algorithm
>> 2) Implementing LDA algorithm from scratch and then classifying the dataset with our LDA then comparing our accuracy with the accuracy of built-in LDA.

> #### In First Phase
>> We read dataset and split it into 85% training data and 15% testing data
>> Then we use built-in LDA to fit and transform training data to apply dimensionality reduction and then predict the labels for the testing data.

> #### In Second Phase
>> I created a class for my LDA and added some functions (Fit, Transorm, Predict)
>> Fit function: its purpose is to apply dimensionality reduction and calculate the wieghts of data
>> Transform function: its purpose is to execute dimensionality reduction.
>> Predict function: its purpose is to use the wieghts generated by the Fit function and generate equations to classify and predict the labels of testing data

Finally, I just used the Fit and Transform functions to plot the data becuase you cannot plot the data without applying dimensionality reduction and used Predict function to predict labels of testing data, then compared my accuracy with the accuracy of built-in LDA.
